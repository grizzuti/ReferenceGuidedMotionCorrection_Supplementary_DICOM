# Reference-guided retrospective motion correction for MRI

3D results (DICOM) of the experiments detailed in the paper:

- G. Rizzuti, T. Schakel, N. R. F. Huttinga, J. W. Dankbaar, T. van Leeuwen, and A. Sbrizzi, *Towards retrospective motion correction and reconstruction for clinical 3D brain MRI protocols with a reference contrast*, 2023

For each experiment, compare the motion *corrupted* scan, *corrected* scan (with the proposed methodology), and *ground-truth* scan.
